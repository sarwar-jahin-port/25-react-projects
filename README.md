<h1 align="left">25 React Projects</h1>

###

<p align="left">Hello there, I was searching for a way to sharpen my knowledge of ReactJS through some projects. Fortunately, I found a freeCodeCamp post where they offered 25 React projects for beginners, which will improve or test their abilities in React. So, without further ado, I started building the projects mostly by myself. However, when I got stuck, I observed how they approached solving the problem. Then, I tried to implement it myself. But if I still failed, I looked at how they coded it. If I understood it, then well and good. If not, ChatGPT was there to help.</p>
